# Mobile App with Expo Go

## Scaffolding the project
- Create a new folder
- Change directory into the folder
- Run the command ```npx create-expo-app@latest .```
- Start the expo development server with ```npx expo start```
- Scan the qr code with the expo go app downloaded from the play store.

## Observations from the reset-project command
- Stop the server and run ```npm run reset-project```
- This creates a separate app-example folder containing the template code.
